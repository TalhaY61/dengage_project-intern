Its a web api project, which im doing in my internship at D-Engage.

D-Engage is a customer engagement and marketing automation platform. They offer services for businesses to engage with their customers through various channels like web push notifications, 
in-app messaging, email marketing, and more.

In this Project basically you can use the CRUD Functions to add "Customer", "Category", "Orders" and "Product", which are saved in MySQL Database. Using the Swagger Web to visualize the CRUD 
Functions. Applying the DDD (Design Driven Pattern) and SOLID (represents five principles of object-oriented programming design) to my Project, helped me improve my coding skills. Also I have used 
the Entity Framework in this Project.
