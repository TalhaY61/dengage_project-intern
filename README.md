This is a Web API project I developed during my internship at D-Engage, a customer engagement and marketing automation platform. D-Engage provided businesses with tools to connect with their customers through various channels such as web push notifications, in-app messaging, and email marketing.

The project implemented full CRUD operations for managing customers, categories, orders, and products, with data stored in a MySQL database. The API was documented and tested using Swagger UI for easy visualization of endpoints.

By applying DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, I improved the structure, maintainability, and quality of the code. The project also made extensive use of Entity Framework for object-relational mapping (ORM).
